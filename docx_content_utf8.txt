Scenario
This coursework will focus on continuing the development of your SaaS application from SSP1, now using the Laravel 12 Framework.
Assume that your system is being migrated from its legacy PHP implementation into a modern Laravel-based application. You are required to identify which core requirements from SSP1 can be carried over, and which parts need to be refactored, extended, or newly created in Laravel.
You must demonstrate an understanding of the core features of server-side applications, including:
Security and data protection
Encryption and secure storage of sensitive information
Token-based authentication and authorization (e.g., Sanctum or Passport)
Usage of APIs to expose data endpoints for integration or consumption
You will then apply this knowledge to expand your own SaaS application. This should include both:
A Laravel implementation of the SSP1 system�s core features (CRUD, authentication, landing page).
Additional Laravel-based functionality such as API routes, middleware, role management, or integrations that demonstrate scalability.
Task 
You are required to build a web application using Laravel 12, SQL, and Tailwind that meet the requirements stated in the table below.

Submission and Assessment
Submission is via LMS. A zipped copy of your code (not a RAR file) should be submitted immediately following your demonstration.
Submission will not be accepted by alternative means (such as email), so you should ensure your submission is made well before the deadline to avoid last-minute problems.
There will be a scheduled demonstration slot for you to show your work. Failure to demonstrate the system during your allocated time slot will automatically give you zero marks regardless of whether the work has been submitted.
The database you choose to build the application on must be based on SQL. If SQLite is used, the DB file must be attached; if MySQL is used, an SQL dump must be attached to the ZIP submission file. If you do need to include a NoSQL database as well, screenshots of your node collections should be included in the submission file under a folder labeled �NoSQL DB Nodes Collections.�
Optional Marks
The marking scheme details 2 components that are optional, the use of a API and the ability to host your application. These 2 can be completed at your own discretion, as these topics will not be covered during lecture hours. You can use the below resources to learn more about these 2 topics. 
Do note, the resources below require an active Linkdlin learning account to use.
